 Assume the following class has been defined:

    class Point {
        protected int x, y;
        
        // no-arg constructor
        public Point() {
            x = y = 0;
        }
        
        // constructor with 2 args
        public Point(int a, int b) {
            x = a;
    	y = b;
        ]
    }

Define a class ColorPoint that:

    is a subclass of the Point class
    has a (protected) field of type String called color (in addition to fields x and y)
    has 3 public constructors:
        0 args: x and y are set to 0; color is set to "red";
        2 int args: x and y are set to the given values; color is set to "red"
        2 int args and 1 String arg: x, y, and color are set to the given values
